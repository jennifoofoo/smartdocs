# Welcome to SmartDocs! 📚🤖

Your personal AI-powered document assistant - completely private and local.

## 🔐 Privacy First

SmartDocs runs **100% locally** on your machine. Your documents never leave your computer, and no data is sent to external services. Perfect for:

- 📄 Personal documents & notes
- 💼 Confidential business files
- 📧 Email archives
- 📊 Research papers & reports

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Ask Questions** - Type your question in natural language
2. **AI Search** - SmartDocs finds relevant sections across all your documents
3. **Get Answers** - Receive precise answers with source citations
4. **Explore Sources** - Click on sources to see exactly where information came from

## 💡 Example Questions

Try asking:

- _"Summarize the meeting notes from last week"_
- _"Find all invoices from Q4 2024"_
- _"What did John say about the project deadline?"_
- _"Compare the terms in contracts A and B"_
- _"What are the action items from recent emails?"_

## ⚙️ Settings

- **LLM Model** - Choose between different AI models
- **Chunk Count** - How many document sections to analyze (more = slower but more thorough)
